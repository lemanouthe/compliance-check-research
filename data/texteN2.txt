1.0 BACKGROUND
The mission of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Office of Information &
Technology (OIT), Office of People Science (OPS), IT Workforce Development (ITWD)
is to provide benefits and services to Veterans of the United States. In meeting these
goals, OIT strives to provide high quality, effective, and efficient Information Technology
(IT) services to those responsible for providing care to the Veterans at the point-of-care
as well as throughout all points of Veterans’ health care in an effective, timely and
compassionate manner. VA depends on Information Management/Information
Technology (IM/IT) systems to meet mission goals.
ITWD maintains responsibility for the design, development, and delivery of IT-specific
training in support of the VA OIT workforce. This includes approximately 8,000 OIT
Government employees and an additional 8,000 contractors. To accomplish its
mission, ITWD delivers internally developed training and industry recognized IT
certification courses using various modalities. This includes physical and virtual
classrooms.
To enable virtual delivery of courses, ITWD has a significant software and hardware
infrastructure. This includes a VA IT Campus Web Application that supports two green
screen studios with control rooms in Shepherdstown, West Virginia and two green
screen studios with control rooms in Washington DC. The VA IT Campus Web
Application (vaitcampus.com) utilizes PIV authentication via SSOe and is hosted in
Amazon AWS Commercial East utilizing Cloudfront and NodeJS Lambda functions as a
serverless application and DynamoDB as a serverless database. Cloud-hosting allows
ITWD to achieve remote delivery of training to the OIT workforce in a manner
decreasing the performance impact on VA internal network components. This is due to
the bandwidth required to stream video content to course attendees and the focus of the
VA internal network to deliver other mission essential resources. The VA IT Campus
Web Application is a collaborative platform to deliver virtual training, meetings, and
conferences to large numbers of simultaneous users at a lower cost and more timely
than traditional physical classroom activities and provides for automatic Talent
Management System (TMS) credit.
